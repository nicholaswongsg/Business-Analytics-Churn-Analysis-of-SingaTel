# Problem Defination
There is a concern regarding customers that leave SingaTel and subscribing to its competitors. Customers are precious assets to companies, and are essential to the survival of these companies. Therefore, in order to maintain a good customer base and ensuring the success of the company, SingaTel has decided to engage the analytics team to identify attributes contributing to customers who have left and likely to leave in the future. Using the data collected, the analytics team will seek to understand the customerâ€™s reasons for churning and propose solutions.

# Business Objective
The business objective of SingaTel is to analyze the customers who have left and most likely to leave in the future, and their reasons for leaving. After which, recommendations will be proposed to SingaTel to help them retain their existing customers and discourage churn.

# Conclusion
After taking into consideration all the factors we have discussed above, we have come up with the following recommendation for SingaTel to dissuade their customers from churning, specifically the senior citizens and adults.

<b>Special offer for Senior Citizens:</b>
For the senior citizens, some of the recommendations include providing them with some extra channels for their TV services as senior citizens typically enjoy watching TV at home and having more channels is likely to persuade them to remain with SingaTel.
Also, to help senior citizens with their movie streaming, a free router will be included whenever they recontract their internet service early.
Lastly, an additional 1gb of data per month will be included in their contract if they renew their contract early. This persuades the senior citizens from churning through contract renewal promotions and freebies.

<b>Special offer for Adults:</b>
For the adults, they typically watch less TV and instead use more of internet services and mobile services. Therefore, to persuade adults to remain with SingaTel, we have come up with an early renewal plan which includes a free gift as well as extra 2gb of data for the first 3 months when they renew their contracts early.
Lastly, regarding internet service, we have also come up with a plan to provide the adults with a free new router whenever they renew their internet service contract, thereby persuading them to remain as customers of SingaTel by promoting contract renewal with enticing promotions and freebies.
